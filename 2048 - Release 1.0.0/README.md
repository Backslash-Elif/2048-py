## About this project:

My project is a 2048 game that I developed entirely in Python. I wanted to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience, so I utilized modules like Turtle and Pynput to design a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). To enhance the gameplay, I incorporated modules like Pydub to add enjoyable background music. To make it even more accessible, I implemented controller input support using Pygame. This allows players to use gamepads or controllers to play the game. With these features, my 2048 game offers an immersive and captivating experience for Python enthusiasts.

## System requirements:

- Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 or higher
